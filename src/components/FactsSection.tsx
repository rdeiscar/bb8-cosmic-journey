                The BB8 Observatory's design isn't just for show ‚Äì the spherical shape actually improves structural 
                stability during high winds compared to traditional observatory designs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The dome rotation mechanism uses a modified version of the same technology that powered the actual
                BB8 prop from the Star Wars films, adapted for precision astronomical tracking.

                During construction, over 200 custom parts had to be machined specifically for this project, 
                making it truly one-of-a-kind in the world of amateur astronomy.

              <p>
                On special occasions like May 4th (Star Wars Day), the observatory runs a special sequence of 
                light patterns visible to neighbors, celebrating its cinematic inspiration.
